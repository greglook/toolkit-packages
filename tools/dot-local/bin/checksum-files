# This script produces a listing of files and the hash of their contents. By
# default, it uses the current directory, or one may be provided as the first
# argument.
#
# The paths in the file listing are truncated to be relative paths from the
# given location. For example, invoking the script with `/foo/bar` as the
# argument would produce a line of output for `foo/bar/baz/abc.py` like:
#
#     dfa1b0b6ef47a15c600b094a93e56002 baz/abc.py
#
# This is so that the same file tree produces the same output, regardless of
# the location in the filesystem.
